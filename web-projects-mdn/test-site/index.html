    <p>I am making a test site, loosely following the MDN guide. I'm already familiar with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Basic JavaScript but I need to brush up on some things :3</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I've been using <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> to relearn code. Unfortunately I don't have access to the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development">Web Developer course</a>  without a subscription. Cameron offered to pay for it for me, which I might have taken up if he could just pay for the course but I don't want the subscription. Maybe I'll try doing the free trial and cramming the course in during the free period later.</p>
